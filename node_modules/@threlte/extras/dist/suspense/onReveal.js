/**
 * ### `onReveal`
 *
 * This hook is used to trigger a callback when the component is revealed (i.e.,
 * no longer suspended). It works within the boundaries of the <Suspense>
 * component and mimics Svelte's lifecycle method `onMount` If there is no
 * <Suspense> component, the callback will be executed immediately as the
 * component will never suspend.
 *
 * Note: This hook triggers with Svelte's `onMount` and can be used in its place
 * for triggering animations, etc., within the boundaries of a <Suspense>
 * component. Just like `onMount` you may return a cleanup function to be
 * executed when the component is unmounted or when the component is suspended
 * again.
 *
 * @param {() => void} callback - The function to be executed when the component
 * is revealed.
