# GIDI - a visualiser for MIDI

A free web application intended for live performances. By interpreting MIDI note on/off messages GIDI then renders and animates a scene on a web browser.

## How to use

1. Go to [gidi.uk](https://gidi.uk)
2. The browser will show a prompt 'gidi.uk wants to "Control and reprogram your MIDI devices"', click 'Allow'
3. Plug in a MIDI instrument to your PC using a MIDI-to-USB cable (or for newer MIDI devices a USB-C cable)
4. Select a 'Style' from the following 5 options: 'Piano', 'Smoke', 'Mirror', 'Swirl', 'Cube'
5. Play
