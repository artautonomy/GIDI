# GIDI - a visualiser for MIDI

A free web application intended for live performances. By interpreting MIDI note on/off messages GIDI renders and animates a scene on a web browser. GIDI offers:

- Multiple styles to choose from (Piano, Firework, Mirror, Swirl, Cube)
- Full customisation of the scene e.g. change note/expression/background colours, Lighting, Autorotate, Attack & Release
- Record camera animations, transition shots by either 'Note down' or 'Time'

## Guide

1. Plug in a MIDI instrument to your PC using a MIDI-to-USB cable
2. Go to [gidi.uk](https://gidi.uk)
3. The browser will show a prompt 'gidi.uk wants to "Control and reprogram your MIDI devices"', click 'Allow'
4. Press the button "I've connected a MIDI device" or simply interact with the scene
5. Select a 'Style' from the following 5 options: 'Piano', 'Firework', 'Mirror', 'Swirl', 'Cube'
