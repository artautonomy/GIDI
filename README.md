# GIDI

[GIDI](https://gidi.uk) is a free, open source web application for musicians using MIDI. By interpreting MIDI messages it can visualise performances on a web browser.

If you know any electronic musicians who could benefit from using GIDI do spread the word.

## How to use GIDI

1. Plug in a MIDI instrument to your PC using a MIDI-to-USB cable (or for newer MIDI devices a USB-C cable)
2. Go to [gidi.uk](https://gidi.uk)
3. The browser will show a prompt 'gidi.uk wants to "Control and reprogram your MIDI devices"', click 'Allow'
4. Select a 'Style' (Piano, Smoke, Mirror, Cube)
